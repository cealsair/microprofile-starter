[MicroProfile starter - Generate MicroProfile Maven Project](https://test-start.microprofile.io/index.xhtml)

The MicroProfile Starter is a community-driven project that provides guided examples for the different APIs under the MicroProfile specification. The examples, based on best practices, are code samples to help you get familiar with MicroProfile APIs so that you can get started quickly on developing and implementing your business logic.

## How do implementations get added to the list of valid implementations of MicroProfile
There are currently more than 8 MicroProfile implementations in the market. If you would like to add your implementation to the microprofile-starter project, please do a PR and follow the instructions located here (TBD - Rudy DeBusscher is writing this doc) to enable your implementation, e.g. add it to the pop-down menu, in the microprofile-starter.
Please note, that for your implementation to be merged into the microprofile-starter, your implementation must fulfill the following criteria:
1. Make sure your implementation passes the MicroProfile TCK
2. An entry for your implementation appears in the [list of "Eclipse MicroProfile Releases"](https://wiki.eclipse.org/MicroProfile/Implementation)
3. Your entry in step 2 above must include the link to the successful results of the MicroProfile TCK for your implementation
